/*
C switch statement is used when you have multiple possibilities for the if statement. Switch case will allow you to choose from multiple options. 
When we compare it to a general electric switchboard, you will have many switches in the switchboard but you 
will only select the required switch, similarly, the switch case allows you to set the necessary statements for the user.
