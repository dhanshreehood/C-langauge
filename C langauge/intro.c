/* FACTS:
In 1988, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) had formalized the C language.
C was invented to write UNIX operating system.
C is a successor of 'Basic Combined Programming Language' (BCPL) called B language.
Linux OS, PHP, and MySQL are written in C.
C has been written in assembly language.
*/

/* USES:
Database systems
Graphics packages
Word processors
Spread sheets
Operating system development
Compilers and Assemblers
Network drivers
Interpreters
*/

/* WHY C IS POPULAR?
-One of the early programming languages.
-Still, the best programming language to learn quickly.
-C language is reliable, simple, and easy to use.
-C language is a structured language.
-Modern programming concepts are based on C.
-It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.
-Universities preferred to add C programming in their courseware.
*/

/* FEATURES
-C is a robust language with a rich set of built-in functions and operators.
-Programs written in C are efficient and fast.
-C is highly portable; programs once written in C can be run on other machines with minor or no modification.
-C is a collection of C library functions; we can also create our function and add it to the C library.
-C is easily extensible.
*/

/* ADVANTAGES
-C is the building block for many other programming languages.
-Programs written in C are highly portable.
-Several standard functions are there (like in-built) that can be used to develop programs.
-C programs are collections of C library functions, and it's also easy to add functions to the C library.
-The modular structure makes code debugging, maintenance, and testing easier.
*/

/* DISADVANTAGES
-C does not provide Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
-There are no concepts of Namespace in C.
-C does not provide binding or wrapping up of data in a single unit.
-C does not provide Constructor and Destructor.
*/

/* COMPILER IN C-
-A compiler is a computer program that transforms human-readable (programming language) source code into another computer language (binary) code.
-The process of transforming the code from High-Level Language to Machine Level Language is called "Compilation".
-processor understands zeroes and ones (binary) only.
-All C program execution is based on a processor which is available in the CPU; that is why entire C source code needs to be converted to the binary system by the compiler.
