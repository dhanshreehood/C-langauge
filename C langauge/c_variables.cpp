/* VARIABLES
-Variables are memory locations(storage area) in the C programming language.
-The primary purpose of variables is to store data in memory for later use. 
Unlike constants which do not change during the program execution, variables
 value may change during execution. If you declare a variable in C, that means
you are asking the operating system to reserve a piece of memory with that 
variable name.
